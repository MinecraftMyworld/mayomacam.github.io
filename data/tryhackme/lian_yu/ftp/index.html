    <p class="h2-size" style="color: white;">Oliver Jonas "Ollie" Queen was a former billionaire playboy, turned archer superhero of Star City.

Lost from society after his family's yacht sank, Oliver made it to the island of Lian Yu, where he went on a mission of survival and self-discovery, learning skills that include, and aren't limited to, archery, swordsmanship, hand-hand combat, etc. He traveled to China and Russia on missions as an agent of A.R.G.U.S. for some time, became a member of the Bratva known as Kapot, and the murderous vigilante Luchnik/Kapiushon. After being presumed dead and lost at sea for five years, Oliver returned home with a mission to save his city from crime and corruption. He began his crusade as an archer who would eventually become known as the Hood, who was willing to use lethal force by targeting members on his father's list.

Imagine you were deserted on an island for five years and you had nothing but a bow and <b>arrow</b> to survive. Lian Yu is a large, mountainous island in the East China Sea in the DC Universe. It has everything you need to survive such as trees, mountains, and you could roleplay or just use it as a survival island for personal needs or wants. I hope you enjoy!.</p>
